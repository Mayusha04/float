    <p>WhatsApp started as an alternative to SMS. 
        Our product now supports sending and receiving a variety of media: text, photos, videos, documents, and location, as well as voice calls. 
        Some of your most personal moments are shared with WhatsApp, which is why we built end-to-end encryption into our app. 
        Behind every product decision is our desire to let people communicate anywhere in the world without barriers.

        <p>With Spider-Man's identity now revealed, our friendly neighborhood web-slinger is unmasked and no longer able 
            to separate his normal life as Peter Parker from the high stakes of being a superhero. 
            When Peter asks for help from Doctor Strange, the stakes become even more dangerous, 
            forcing him to discover what it truly means to be Spider-Man.
